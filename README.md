# Dotfiles

Based on [Paul Miller's](https://github.com/paulmillr/dotfiles) dotfiles

Colourful & robust configuration files and utilities for Mac, Linux and BSD. Installation is done with a simple command:

```sh
curl -L https://git.io/Jff1G | sh
```

The short URL expands to GitHub-hosted `install.sh`, which can be easily audited.

## Usage

    - Optionally `sh etc/bootstrap-macos.sh`
- **Linux and BSD:** Ensure you have `git` and `zsh` installed.
- **Git:** Don't forget to adjust `home/.gitconfig` or you'll have improper commit author
